Gaussian processes have already been used to solve such signal strength localization problems. We extend this work to indoor WiFi localization and present novel kernel functions which increase the accuracy of the Gaussian process model, especially when faced with sparse training data.

Based on a semantic concept expansion component, our application is able to find similar words that resonate better in the same context and propose word replacements to improve the overall likelihood of success.\\\\ For this demonstration, we are using Twitter messages and an audience of Cloud Computing experts and enthusiasts.
